                    On 30 March, Vincent Willem van Gogh was born in Zundert, the eldest son of the Protestant<br> 
                    clergyman Theodorus van Gogh (1822 - 1885) and Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819-1907).</li>

                <li class="li-items"><span>1861-1868</span>
                    Vincent's school career was fragmented: he attended the village school in Zundert for a year,<br>
                    followed by two years at a boarding school in Zevenbergen and eighteen months at the Willem<br>
                    II 'Rijks-HBS' (grammar school) in Tilburg.</li>
                <li class="li-items"><span>1869-1876</span>

                    Van Gogh joined the international art dealer Goupil & Co. in The Hague on 30 July 1869 as a <br>
                    junior apprentice. The manager of the firm was H. G. Tersteeg. Goupil also had branches in<br>
                    Paris, London and Brussels. The lengthy exchange of letters with his younger brother Theo<br>
                    started in August 1872 in The Hague. On 1 January 1873, Theo also joined the staff of Goupil & <br>
                    Co. and was appointed to the Brussels branch. On 13 June, Vincent was posted to Goupil's<br>
                    London branch, where he was to stay until 15 May 1875 - apart from a three-month transfer to<br>
                    Paris. Then, against his will, he was posted permanendy to Paris. His aversion to the art trade <br>
                    grew steadily. He immersed himself in the Bible and lived in seclusion. After his dismissal from<br>
                    Boussod & Valadon, the successors to Goupil, he returned to his parents' home in Etten in 1876. <br></li>
                <li class="li-items"><span>1876-1880</span>
                    Vincent worked as a teacher at a boarding school in Ramsgate from mid-April 1876 until July,<br>
                    when he moved to a post in Isleworth on the outskirts of London, where he was also allowed to <br>
                    preach occasionally. Lack of opportunities prompted him to return to the Netherlands at <br>
                    Christmas 1876 and he worked briefly in a bookshop in Dordrecht. In May he moved to <br>
                    Amsterdam to prepare himself for theological studies. In May 1878 he gave this up and, after a <br>
                    brief training in Laeken outside Brussels, moved in December to the Borinage region of <br>
                    Belgium, where he worked among the miners as an evangelist. In August 1880, Van Gogh<br>
                    decided to become an artist. To prepare himself, he started copying drawings and reproductions<br>
                    of work by Jean-Francois Millet, the painter of peasant life. <br>

                <li class="li-items"><span>1881 - </span>
                    He stayed in Brussels in the winter and met the painter Anthon van Rappard there. He received<br>
                    financial support from Theo. In April he returned to live with his parents in Etten. He continued <br>
                    studying, using mainly motifs from peasant life. At the end of November, he spent a few weeks <br>
                    in The Hague working with his cousin by marriage, the painter Anton Mauve, under whose<br>
                    guidance he produced his first water-colours and stilllifes in oils. A bitter altercation around<br>
                    Christmas led to estrangement from his parents. Van Gogh departed for The Hague. <br>
